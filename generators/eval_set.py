"""Self-contained evaluation-set export, owned entirely by this repo.

`export_eval_set` produces two sibling directories under one output root::

    <out>/synthetic_<YYYYMMDD>/     <out>/degraded_<YYYYMMDD>/
      CASE001_bank_statement.png      CASE001_receipt_v1.png
      CASE001_invoice.png             CASE001_receipt_v2.png
      CASE001_receipt.png             CASE001_receipt_v3.png
      ...  165 images, 3 types        ...  165 images, receipts only
      ground_truth.csv                ground_truth.csv     <- describes THESE rows
      ground_truth.jsonl              ground_truth.jsonl   <- describes THESE rows

The two halves are NOT mirrors of each other, and the asymmetry is the whole
design. Four properties are load-bearing:

* **The degraded half holds receipts only, one image per severity tier.**
  Receipts are the only type users photograph -- bank statements and invoices
  arrive as clean PDFs or printouts -- so degrading the other two models
  nothing. 55 receipts x the 3 tiers declared under ``receipt_degradation:``
  in ``config/generation_config.yml`` is again 165 images, but they are 55
  documents at 3 severities, not 165 distinct documents.
* **A degraded filename carries its tier**: ``CASE001_receipt.png`` becomes
  ``CASE001_receipt_v1.png`` and up, taking the suffix from the tier's own
  ``suffix:`` key. Anything pairing the two halves must therefore join on the
  filename with that suffix removed, NOT on the filename itself.
* **Filenames are generic** -- ``CASE001_bank_statement.png``, never
  ``CASE001_cba_standard.png``. The layout variant must not leak, or a model
  could infer the template before reading a pixel. The type portion is the
  canonical document-type key from ``config/extraction_schema.yml``, so the
  schema is the single source of that name. Case ids stay unsuffixed so
  ``transaction_links.yml`` keeps resolving.
* **Each directory is self-contained**, carrying the ground truth for the
  images IT holds, so a model run points at one path and finds everything.
  The degraded ground truth is written rather than copied: each variant row
  repeats its source receipt's field values verbatim and differs only in
  ``image_file``, so a copy of the clean file would name images this
  directory does not contain. The two ground truths are consequently NOT
  byte-identical, and the degraded one carries only the receipt columns.

The schema projection this export needs -- which fields a document type is
scored on, in what order, and which are monetary or boolean -- comes from
`generators.exporters.eval_projection`, reading
``config/extraction_schema.yml``. Nothing here shells out to, or imports
from, another repository.

Record order is the CSV's column order: records are emitted sorted by
filename, so the first record is a bank statement and its five fields lead
the header, exactly as the pinned format requires. Nothing is sorted or
set-ified anywhere order is observable.

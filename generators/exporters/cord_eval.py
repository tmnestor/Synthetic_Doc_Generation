This module is a DERIVED WORK: it re-implements ``JSONParseEvaluator``'s
public behaviour (``cal_acc``, ``cal_f1``) and every normalisation step it
performs before comparing trees (``flatten``, ``normalize_dict``,
``construct_tree_from_dict``), ported line-for-line where the algorithm
does not depend on the tree-edit-distance backend.

WHAT WAS CHANGED, AND WHY
--------------------------
The original evaluator is only importable via the ``donut-python`` PyPI
package, whose unbounded ``datasets[vision]`` dependency backtracks to
``datasets==1.8.0`` -> ``pyarrow==3.0.0`` -> ``numpy==1.19.4``, none of which
have Python 3.12 / arm64 wheels (see the project's Task 6 investigation).
Rather than drag in that (unusable, multi-GB, ML-training-oriented)
dependency tree for a ~200-line scoring utility, this module is vendored
directly into the repository, per
``GroundTruth_Export_Spec.md``'s own explicit sanctioning of
"pip install donut-python, or copy (deps zss + nltk)".

Within that vendoring, one further substitution was made, also per the
spec: the original's tree-edit-distance backend, ``zss``
(https://pypi.org/project/zss/), carries a non-SPDX / historically-GPL
licence questionable for vendoring into this codebase. This port uses
``apted`` (MIT, https://pypi.org/project/apted/) instead. ``apted`` and
``zss`` both compute the *exact* (not approximate) tree edit distance for
ordered labelled trees under insert/delete/rename operations -- ``zss``
implements the classic Zhang-Shasha algorithm and ``apted`` implements the
newer, faster APTED algorithm for the same well-defined problem -- so for
an identical cost model the two backends must produce numerically
identical distances. The substitution is therefore in *backend*, not in
*metric*: this module translates ``zss``'s three cost callbacks
(``update_cost``, ``insert_and_remove_cost`` used for both insert and
remove) into ``apted``'s ``Config`` interface (``rename``, ``delete``,
``insert``, ``children``) with the same per-node-pair cost values.

The original's leaf-label string-edit-distance uses ``nltk.edit_distance``
(plain Levenshtein, unit costs, no transpositions). This port uses
``rapidfuzz.distance.Levenshtein.distance`` instead (MIT-licensed;
``nltk`` is GPL-side-effect-free but drags in a large corpus-download
ecosystem this project has no other use for). ``rapidfuzz``'s default
weights (1, 1, 1) reproduce standard Levenshtein distance identically to
``nltk.edit_distance``'s defaults -- verified directly against ``nltk`` for
this port (see Task 6 report) rather than assumed.

ONE DELIBERATE, DOCUMENTED BEHAVIOUR CHANGE
--------------------------------------------
The original ``cal_acc`` divides by
``zss.distance(<empty tree>, answer_tree, ...)``. When ``answer``
normalises to nothing (e.g. ``answer == {}``), that denominator is exactly
0, and the original evaluator raises a bare, undiagnosed
``ZeroDivisionError`` (confirmed by direct testing of the unmodified
upstream code against this exact input as part of this port -- it does
NOT return 1.0, despite that being a natural-seeming assumption). Per this
project's fail-fast convention, this port instead raises a diagnostic
``ValueError`` for that degenerate case rather than silently returning a
number OR crashing with an unlabelled exception. This is a genuine,
intentional divergence from upstream behaviour, called out here so nobody
mistakes this module for a byte-for-byte port at every edge case.
``cal_f1`` has the equivalent guard for its own 0/0 case (both field lists
empty), for the same reason.

Public interface (matches the original's shape):

    cal_f1(preds: list[dict], answers: list[dict]) -> float

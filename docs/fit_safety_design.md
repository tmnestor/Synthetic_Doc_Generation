# Phase 0 — Fit Safety: Design Spec

> Status: approved design (brainstorming output). Precursor to the content-variety
> programme. This spec covers **fit safety only** — the guardrail that makes later
> content widening (Phases 1–3) safe. It changes no content and is designed to
> leave the current 220 documents byte-identical.

## 1. Goal & the contract it protects

Guarantee that every rendered image shows the **exact full string** stored in
ground truth — no horizontal clipping, no column collision, no silent truncation
— so the pixel-perfect image ↔ ground-truth contract holds **by construction**,
for both today's 220 frozen documents and future widened content.

Overflow becomes *structurally impossible* for anything a layout can actually
hold. The only failure path is genuinely-impossible geometry (a string that
cannot fit even at the font floor across the reserved line band), which fails
loud with a diagnostic — never silently.

### Why this must ship before content widening

The renderers place text into fixed positions with no wrapping, truncation, or
fit-to-width check (`generators/common.py`: `draw_text_center`,
`draw_text_right`, `draw_line_item` use `font.getbbox()` for alignment only).
Widening content produces longer, variable-length strings that would silently
clip or overlap — corrupting the benchmark, because the GT YAML stores the full
string while the image shows a clipped one. An LLM is then scored against text it
cannot see. Fit safety and content variety must not be decoupled; this is the
prerequisite.

## 2. YAML schema — budgets are the single source of truth

Each layout in `config/layouts/*.yml` gains a `field_budgets` block. Every
variable field a renderer draws gets an explicit entry. **All keys are required**
— per the project's YAML-is-source-of-truth and fail-fast rules, there are no
silent Python defaults. A missing field entry, or a missing key within one, is a
startup validation error.

```yaml
field_budgets:
  NAME_ADDRESS:
    width: 380              # px — the field's horizontal box
    fit: shrink_then_wrap   # one of: shrink | wrap | shrink_then_wrap
    min_font: 12            # font-size floor; below this -> fail, do not shrink further
    max_lines: 2            # vertical band reserved for this field (>=1)
  AMOUNT:
    width: 120
    fit: shrink
    min_font: 14
    max_lines: 1            # non-wrapping fields declare max_lines: 1 explicitly
```

### Key semantics

| Key | Meaning | Constraints |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `width` | Horizontal box in px the string must fit within | Positive int. **Derived from current renderer geometry** (see §5) so day-one output is unchanged. |
| `fit` | Allowed lossless fit strategy for this field | Enum: `shrink`, `wrap`, `shrink_then_wrap`. |
| `min_font` | Smallest font size fitting may shrink to | Positive int ≤ the field's nominal size. |
| `max_lines` | Lines the field may occupy (reserved vertical band) | Int ≥ 1. Non-wrapping fields (amounts, table columns) use `1`. |

### Fit-strategy guidance per field class

- **Amounts, table-row columns** — cannot wrap without breaking the row grid →
  `fit: shrink`, `max_lines: 1`.
- **Header blocks** (business name, address) where the layout can reserve
  vertical space → `fit: wrap` or `fit: shrink_then_wrap`, `max_lines: 2+`.

Operator intent is fully visible in the YAML: reading `field_budgets` alone
answers "how is this field allowed to fit?" without consulting Python.

## 3. Fit mechanism — `fit_text()` in `common.py`

A shared helper that renderers call instead of drawing text raw. It is the
mechanism that enforces the contract; validation (§4) is only a backstop.

**Inputs:** the full string, the field's budget (`width`, `fit`, `min_font`,
`max_lines`), the draw origin, and the resolved bundled font.

**Algorithm:**

1. Measure the string with `font.getbbox()` at the field's nominal size.
2. **If it fits** the `width` at nominal size → draw as-is. This is the day-one
   path for all 220 current documents (widths are derived from existing
   geometry), so there is **no visual change** to the passing corpus.
3. **If it does not fit**, apply the field's `fit` strategy losslessly:
   - `shrink` — reduce font size toward `min_font` until the string fits on one
     line.
   - `wrap` — break the string across up to `max_lines`, each line within
     `width`, at the nominal size.
   - `shrink_then_wrap` — attempt `shrink` first; if still not fitting at
     `min_font`, wrap the shrunk text across up to `max_lines`.
4. **If the full string cannot fit even at `min_font` across `max_lines`** →
   raise a four-element diagnostic error (§6). The helper **never truncates or
   ellipsizes** — the only outcomes are "fits losslessly" or "fails loud."

The full string that renders is always exactly the string GT stores; the image ↔
GT contract is preserved regardless of length.

---

## 4. Validation backstop — `pipeline validate`

`python -m generators.pipeline validate` runs the same measurement across every
ground-truth entry against its layout's budgets. It **collects all** genuinely-
unfittable violations into a single report, then exits non-zero (fail on the
batch, not on the first offender — so a reseed surfaces every problem in one
pass).

This gate fires **only** for impossible geometry — content that cannot fit even
with lossless shrink+wrap. Routine length variation is handled at render time by
`fit_text()` and does **not** trip validation. When it does fire, the offending
field represents a real layout design error a human must resolve (widen the box,
raise `max_lines`, or lower `min_font` in the YAML).

The overflow check also runs inside `generate` before rendering, so a clipped
image can never be produced even if `validate` is skipped.

---

## 5. Deriving budgets from current renderer geometry

Today the layouts carry no per-field boxes; geometry is hardcoded in the
renderers (e.g. `draw_line_item` right-aligns the amount at `content_width`, so
the description box is `left_margin → amount_x − gap`). Phase 0 does **not**
migrate all geometry into YAML (that is out of scope, §8). Instead:

1. Read each variable field's effective horizontal box off what the renderer
   already draws.
2. Commit those widths into the layout `field_budgets` as the authoritative
   source of truth.
3. Renderers call `fit_text(field, ...)` which looks up the budget; they keep
   their existing x/y drawing. Only the *fit constraint* is new.

Because the derived widths match current reality, all 220 documents render
unchanged on day one.

---

## 6. Determinism preconditions

Pixel measurement is only safe if the font is identical on the local Mac and on
PROD Linux.

1. **Bundled fonts (verified).** All four DejaVu faces
   (`fonts/DejaVuSans*.ttf`, `DejaVuSansMono*.ttf`) are committed, git-tracked,
   and `load_font()` searches the bundled directory first; system fonts are
   fallbacks only. So both platforms load the same TTF and `getbbox()` agrees.
2. **Pin Pillow.** `environment.yml` currently has a bare `- pillow`, while
   `faker` and `opencv-python-headless` are pinned for byte-stable reproducibility.
   Pillow's FreeType version drives `getbbox()` widths → every shrink/wrap
   decision → the rendered pixels. Pin it (`pillow==<current>`, version captured
   from the maintainer's live env at implementation time) with a comment
   mirroring the faker/opencv rationale.
3. **Fail-loud font-source guard.** `load_font()` silently falls back to system
   fonts when a bundled file is missing. `fit_text()` must measure against the
   *bundled* face; add a diagnostic hard-fail if the loaded font is not the
   bundled one, so a missing bundle can never silently degrade to Helvetica on
   Mac and diverge from PROD.

### Diagnostic error shape (fail-fast, four elements)

Both the render-time impossible-fit error and the validation backstop use the
project's four-element diagnostic (**what / where / what-it-should-look-like /
how-to-recover**), e.g.:

```
✗ Content overflow: field NAME_ADDRESS cannot fit even at the font floor.
  Entry:    CASE037  (receipts / receipt_thermal_57mm)
  Field:    NAME_ADDRESS
  Measured: 412px at min_font 12 across max_lines 2  ·  Budget width: 380px
  String:   "Nguyen & Associates Chartered Accountants Pty Ltd"

  Where:    config/layouts/receipt.yml
            -> receipt_thermal_57mm.field_budgets.NAME_ADDRESS
  Expected: width >= measured, or increase max_lines, or lower min_font.
  Recover:  raise `width` to >=412 (or `max_lines` to 3) under that key.
            Budgets are the single source of truth — never silently truncate.
```

## 7. Testing (TDD, local `tests/`)

Tests are local-only (`tests/` is gitignored). Minimum 80% coverage.

- **`fit_text` core:** returns text that fits within the box; **never** returns a
  truncated/ellipsized string; output is deterministic across runs.
- **Per strategy:** `shrink` floors at `min_font`; `wrap` respects `max_lines`
  and `width`; `shrink_then_wrap` shrinks before wrapping.
- **Impossible fit:** raises the four-element diagnostic (shared
  `assert_diagnostic_error` helper asserts all four elements present).
- **Validation backstop:** collects *all* violations into one report and exits
  non-zero; does not trip on content that fits via lossless fit.
- **Font-source guard:** raises a diagnostic when the bundled font is absent.
- **Regression:** all 220 current documents render byte-identically to
  pre-change output (day-one derived widths cause no visual change).

## 8. Scope / non-goals

**In scope:**
- `field_budgets` schema in `config/layouts/*.yml` (all keys required).
- `fit_text()` in `generators/common.py` and renderer wiring.
- Overflow validation backstop in `pipeline validate` (and `generate`).
- Pillow pin in `environment.yml`.
- Bundled-font fail-loud guard.
- Tests + all-four-doc-type regression.

**Out of scope (later work):**
- Content widening — bigger pools, procedural composition, edge-case matrix
  (Phases 1–3 of the content-variety programme).
- Generation-time content regeneration/shortening in `seed_ground_truth.py`.
- Full geometry-to-YAML migration of renderer coordinates.
